# zh_CN+TW-Lang-Package-1.20.1
**Languages/语言:**&emsp;[简体中文](README.md)｜[**English**](README-en.md)
## Introduction
A lightweight mod translation resource pack providing **Simplified Chinese**\[zh_cn\] and **Traditional Chinese**\[zh_tw\] translations (with **primary focus** on Traditional Chinese). Due to academic commitments, my time is limited, so the initial version only includes translations for mods I personally play.

## Todo
See [release notes](https://github.com/3WLRF25/mc-mod-tw-lang/releases/latest)

## Production
> [!NOTE]
> Incorporated some mod translations from predecessors [RPMTW](https://github.com/RPMTW/ResourcePack-Mod-zh_tw), [CFPA](https://github.com/CFPAOrg/Minecraft-Mod-Language-Package), and [chesterccj305](https://github.com/chesterccj305/Mods-zh_tw-Lang-Pack). Grateful acknowledgments :\)

Besides partial translations from the above repositories, the following were used:
- Tools
  - DeepSeek, assisted translation (used only partially, with manual checking, proofreading, and polishing - not pure machine translation)
  - [Natural Simplified-Traditional Conversion](https://www.51shizhi.com/tool/zh-hans-hant-convert), quite practical in my opinion, though sometimes it behaves erratically with strange word breaks requiring manual correction. Website description:
> It converts based on Taiwan Standard Traditional Chinese, then further converts vocabulary commonly used in Simplified Chinese to their Taiwan Traditional Chinese equivalents, e.g.: _自行车→腳踏車，出租车→計程車_
Many systems and applications using "Traditional Chinese" don't specify the variant, typically employing "**Taiwan Standard Traditional Chinese colloquialisms**"
- References
  - [MC Mod Translation Reference Dictionary](https://dict.vmct-cn.top/)
  - [Minecraft Standard Translations](https://mcst.teahouse.team/), also very practical (~~being official translations after all~~)
  - [chesterccj305's Project Wiki](https://github.com/chesterccj305/Mods-zh_tw-Lang-Pack/wiki) Most frequently used. Given the countless names for various items, entities, etc., in Minecraft, and mod-added names being exceptionally diverse, this wiki effectively captures key fundamental rules for Simplified-Traditional translation conversions (e.g., standard translation "下界砖墙" => "地獄磚牆", the wiki directly provides "下界" => "地狱", among other examples), omitting parts consistent between both variants.

## Motivation
The Traditional Chinese localization of vanilla Minecraft impressed me with many stunning translations, like _狱髓_ (Netherite), _窳民_ (Illager), making the game a medium showcasing linguistic and cultural charm. As a heavy mod user, I wanted to try Traditional Chinese community mod localizations, only to find mainstream Traditional Chinese localizations stopped at versions 1.16.5 and 1.18.2. This sparked the idea of creating my own Traditional Chinese localizations. However, with relatively poor language skills (I'm a science student), I could only diligently reference achievements from vanilla Minecraft and community translations (sadly).

## Author's Note (Will anyone read this?)
Given this is merely a project sharing my summer vacation outcome on GitHub, my update frequency will be very low afterward (possibly discontinuing). Of course, if you wish to contribute to improving this project or suggest mods for localization, **feel free to open an issue or discuss on the discussions page**. I'll review them when I have time (guilty.jpg)

----

Achieving complete Chinese localization might be challenging, but the Minecraft Chinese community not only has a large population but also immense passion for Minecraft and mods. The CFPA resource pack repository for Simplified Chinese i18n has nearly 20,000 commits. Coupled with emerging technological products like [AutoTranslation](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/12385.html) and the newer mod [AILocalizer](https://www.mcmod.cn/class/20014.html), I believe the mod localization community will continue to improve.
